# Data Structures

## Introduction

A data structure is a collection of values. Algorithms are the steps we put into place to manipulate these collection of values.  
```
Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
```

## What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a collection of values. Each data structure is different in what it can do and what it is best used for. Each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.

Lets think data structure as a place where we put things such as bag, fridge, drawer, paper bag, toy box etc. Each place has its own purpose. For example, we dont put yoghurt in a drawer, we dont put paper in a fridge. Similar with data structure each data structure has its own purpose.

There are tons of data structure but we only need some of them like 5 or 6 in daily basis. Bitcoin uses block chain which is also a data structure. 

Data structure models a real life scenario, and more advanced developer you become the more time you spent talking and thinking about data structures. This is why interviewers love talking about data structure. 

As there is always trade off. Every programming question has a trade off. Like our 3 pillars of readability, memory and speed has a trade off, data structure also has a trade off. One is better than the other in some aspects, and other better than the other. That why each one is used in a specific case.

Two parts to understand data structure: 
1. How to build one
1. How to use it

First one deals with how to build data structure with code and second deals with how to use built data structure to solve problem. Second one is more important than first one. Because, most of the time, data structure is already pre built in a programming langugage. *The goal is to be able to pick which data structure for which scenario* like we picked object instead of array before in how to solve problem section.
